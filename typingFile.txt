There is. a wonderful moment in The Queen's Gambit.
Its plot is similar to films about martial arts of the eighties and nineties - those in which the hero first defeats everyone in his homeland, in the USA, and then goes to a tournament in a country where real masters live and fight.
So it was in the series: first - the United States, then - fights with the masters.
Which country is the best in chess kung fu.Of course, the USSR.It was there that the main character went - to the wonderful Soviet chess players: smart, confident, generous.
